Goal
Build a responsive, interactive web-based dashboard application for monitoring all projects in an organization.

1) Header

Organization name/logo

Date selector

Global filters: Project Status, Division, Date Range

Dark mode toggle

2) KPI Cards

Total Projects

Active Projects

Completed Projects

Delayed Projects

Total Budget

Actual Spend

Total Amount Received to Date

3) Overall Projects Section (Charts)

Pie — Spending Categories: Within Budget, Under Budget, Overspent, Critical Overspent

Variance% (spend ratio) = ActualSpend / Budget (display as %)

Thresholds:

Under Budget: < 90%

Within Budget: 90%–<110%

Overspent: 110%–<150%

Critical Overspent: ≥ 150%

Pie — Project Status (Performance Index, PI):

Ahead of Schedule: PI ≥ 1.10

On Track: 0.90 ≤ PI < 1.10

Slightly Behind: 0.75 ≤ PI < 0.90

Critical Delay: PI < 0.75

Bar — Projects by Division: Mechanical, Electrical, Instrumentation

4) Project Table (searchable/sortable)

Columns:

Project Code

Project Name

% Completion

Time Completion (days elapsed vs. total and/or % of schedule)

Time% = ElapsedDays / TotalPlannedDays

Budget Variance Category (Within Budget / Under Budget / Overspent / Critical Overspent)

Risk Count

Amount Received Till Date

% Deviation of Profit Margin (actual vs. planned)

PlannedMargin% = (PlannedRevenue - PlannedCost) / PlannedRevenue

ActualMargin% = (ActualRevenue - ActualCost) / ActualRevenue

Deviation% = (ActualMargin% - PlannedMargin%) / PlannedMargin%

Status (Green = On Track, Yellow = At Risk, Red = Delayed, Blue = Completed)

5) Drill-down (on row click)

Show a detailed view with:

Milestones + status

Project Manager

Budget details: Budget (BAC), Actual Spend (AC), Commitments, Forecast, Remaining Budget

Risks and Issues: severity, owner, status, due dates

Upcoming activities: next 14–30 days

Late activities: overdue items

Performance & EV Metrics (with tooltips):

EV (Earned Value) = BAC × %Complete

PV (Planned Value) = BAC × Time%

AC (Actual Cost) = Actual Spend

CPI = EV / AC

SPI = EV / PV

ScPI (Scope PI) = DeliveredScope / PlannedScope

PPI (Project PI) = average of (CPI, SPI, ScPI) unless weights provided

CV (Cost Variance) = EV − AC

SV (Schedule Variance) = EV − PV

EAC (Estimate at Completion) = BAC / CPI (default method)

ETC (Estimate to Complete) = EAC − AC

VAC (Variance at Completion) = BAC − EAC

TCPI (To-Complete Performance Index) = (BAC − EV) / (EAC − AC)

Burn Rate = AC / EV

Cash Flow to Date = AmountReceivedToDate − AC

Time metrics: Start Date, Finish Date, Days Late/Early, Critical Path Float (if available)

Resource metrics: Resource Utilization %, Headcount, Key Roles coverage

Quality & HSE (optional): Defect count, Rework hours, Safety incidents (TRIR)
